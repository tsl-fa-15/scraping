"*Sublet $1025- REMODELED Lakeview 1BD in 2BD Apt! DW, WD, Belmont EL!",/chc/apa/5314101375.html,2015-11-13 11:40,1025,1,,"
Looking for someone to continue my lease, starting 12/1/15-8/31/16. Im looking to rent out my room in a two bedroom apartment. Bedroom fits queen bed, dresser and has large closet with double doors. Roommate has furniture in living room so you would only need bedroom furniture.

Apartment Features:
* Dishwasher
* Hardwood Floors
* Washer/Dryer In Unit
* Shared Deck
* Large Living Room
* Corner Unit facing North and West - Lots of Natural Light
* Walk Up - Second Floor
* Central Heat & AC
* SS Appliances
* Permit Parking right outside front door. 
* Local Parking Garage a few blocks away rents monthly spots.

AMAZING location in the heart of Lakeview, just a few blocks from the Red/Brown/Purple train lines, Jewel, Treasure Island, Trader Joes, Walmart Express, DSW, Marshalls and steps from fabulous bars and restaurants. 

You would be living with a girl who is low key, in her late 20's who works downtown in the design field. Our building has 6 units, 3 floors so only two units per floor.

You won't find a place this nice for this price in this neighborhood, so act fast! Message me if you're interested!

Note: a cat litter box is shown in the bedroom picture, but the cat is leaving with me :)

Contact me with any questions or concerns!
